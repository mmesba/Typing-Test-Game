<!-- The Problems and The Solutions -->
# The problems and The Solutions
I have generated random quotes from api call and receive that data as json format. Then I have split every character and compare with user inputs. If matched proceed to next otherwise marked that exact character as red color so user can identify their mistakes. In the meantime I have started a stopwatch until every character finished. If an user completes a quote then the page will be reloaded and new session will be started.
